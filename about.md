Hi and welcome to my blog page. On this blog page, I share my journey into Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence and other cool stuff in Computer Science. Learning things can be difficult and time taking if we do it alone. That is why I like to share my progress in form of projects that I have done over time, in hope that the knowledge I share can be helpful to others.

Originally from Varanasi, India, I completed my bachelor degree in Mechanical Engineering from Indian Institute of Technology Ropar in May 2017 (just a while ago). However my love for self learning things a.k.a. machine learning brought me here.

I hope that by the help of my blog posts I am able to share some of my knowledge with you.
If you want to connect with me or share interesting stuff you made (so that I can learn too), you can find my credentials in the footer below.

### More Information

Here is a link to my [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/shalabh1) profile. Kaggle also has a blog where they share tutorials for data science [http://blog.kaggle.com/category/tutorials/](see here).

Have a nice time.
