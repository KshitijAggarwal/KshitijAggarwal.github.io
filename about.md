Hi. Welcome to my personal website. 

## Present

I am a PhD student at the Department of Physics and Astronomy at West Virginia University. I write [code](https://github.com/KshitijAggarwal) to find Fast Radio Bursts, and delegate some of my tasks to Machine Learning. You can find the details of my ongoing projects [here](/research/). I like to read, write and watch _Friends_ in my free time. Feel free to look around using the tabs on the top.   

Here is my [CV](/docs/kshitij_cv.pdf), and you can find my publications [here](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/public-libraries/yUUKwaFhRVu2DCvZ4A3HXg).

## Past

Originally from Roorkee, a small town in Uttarakhand, India, I went to [IIT Ropar](http://www.iitrpr.ac.in/) for my undergrad in Electrical Engineering. After a summer internship at [DISTORTION](http://www.rri.res.in/DISTORTION/) group at the [Raman Research Institute](http://www.rri.res.in/) and a couple of projects at [National Centre for Radio Astronomy](http://www.ncra.tifr.res.in/ncra/main), I decided to pursue a PhD in radio astronomy. The transition from Electrical Engineering to an astronomy PhD was pretty interesting, and I plan to write about it in a blog someday.
