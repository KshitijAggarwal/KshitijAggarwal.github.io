Hi. Welcome to my personal webpage. 

I am a PhD student at the Department of Physics and Astronomy at West Virginia University. I write code to find Fast Radio Bursts and study Millisecond Pulsars. You can find the details of my ongoing projects here. I like to read, write and watch _Friends_ in my free time.  

This site is still under construction.
