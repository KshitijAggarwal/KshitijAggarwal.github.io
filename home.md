Hi! Welcome to my personal website. 

I am a PhD student at the Department of Physics and Astronomy at West Virginia University. I write [code](https://github.com/KshitijAggarwal) to find Fast Radio Bursts, and delegate some of my tasks to Machine Learning. You can find the details of my ongoing projects [here](/research/). I like to read, write and watch [_Friends_](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0108778/) in my free time. Feel free to look around using the tabs on the top.   

Here is my [CV](/docs/kshitij_cv.pdf), and you can find my publications [here](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/public-libraries/yUUKwaFhRVu2DCvZ4A3HXg).
