### or stuff that excites me and keeps me up at night ... 

My research focuses on study of Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs). Discovered by [Duncan Lorimer](https://physics.wvu.edu/faculty-and-staff/faculty/duncan-lorimer) in 2007, these bursts are very bright flashes in the sky, originating in the galaxies far far away. As the name suggests, FRBs have been seen only at radio frequencies (400MHz-8GHz). Therefore, I use the amazing radio telescopes in US ([VLA](http://www.vla.nrao.edu/), [GBT](https://greenbankobservatory.org/science/telescopes/gbt/), [Arecibo](https://www.naic.edu/ao/new-landing)) to search for these emigmatic phenomenon. [Sarah Burke-Spolaor](https://sarahspolaor.faculty.wvu.edu/) does the difficult job of supervising my PhD and making sure that I set realistic goals. 

I am a part of the [*`Realfast`*](http://realfast.io/) collaboration, which aims to perform real-time fast transients searches at VLA. Taking advantage of the large baselines of VLA antennas, the *`Realfast`* system can localize FRBs to a very small region in sky (~sub-arcseconds). This is useful as localization is necessary to pin-point FRBs to individual galaxies, which is essential to identify their progenitors.

I also think about efficient search and classification algorithms for FRBs. I (along with [Devansh](https://www.linkedin.com/in/devanshkv)) developed a Deep Learning based classifier called [`Fetch`](https://github.com/devanshkv/fetch) for classification of FRB candidates from noise (RFI) candidates. `Fetch` is currently being used at more than half a dozen radio telescopes all around the world, and has detected new bursts which I cannot talk about here.
